# IOT_water_quality_device
The following project contains comprehensive device used to measure PH, turbidity and rate of flow. With the data obtainded we give a Machine Learning model for effects on algae bloom from PH and turbidity.

## About
The project was built in order to help in the development of the water quality and aims are provide accurate data which can be interpreted from the device, the data obtained is visulized with the help of blynk cloud application which can be downloaded via mobile ios/android apps. The data obtained is interpreted with the help of Machine learning to give a study on the effects on algae from the data points obtained from the device The following device can be implemented in Sewage treatment planets for monitoring and maintainence purposes.

## Machine learning models

The data optained is used to predict the rfu value of phycocanin to determine/predict if algae bloom will happen and help take preventive measures. The model is trained using available datasets.
